            <p>Dhibiti Hali Initiative is a Kenyan based organization that aims at using innovative and creative technological methods in providing solutions to environmental, health and economic challenges facing communities. Our main focus is on Sexual Reproductive Health, Gender Based Violence and Waste Management. We are an institution that embraces research as a mechanism of accelerating and improving provision of services.</p>

           <p>Dhibiti Hali Initiative organization believes that in order to properly tackle economic challenges facing our communities, we should constantly embrace theT.T.I.A. E (Timely, Thought for Ideas and Applied Energy) approach in vital sectors such as Agriculture and Education. A significant growth in those two sectors and a properly conserved environment equate to a healthy and just society. We believe that economic deprivation and poor education are precursors to violence. Our collective efforts in addressing peoples felt needs can no doubt keep the beast of violence away from our communities.</p>
